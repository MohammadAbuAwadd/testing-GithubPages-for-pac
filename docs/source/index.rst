PyHLicorn Documentation 
=======================

The PyHLicorn package aims at inferring a large scale transcription co-regulatory network
from transcriptomic data and at integrating external data on gene regulation to infer and 
analyze transcriptional programs. The particularity of the network inference algorithm 
proposed in the package is to learn co-regulation network in which gene regulation is 
modeled by transcription factors acting in a cooperative manner to synergistically 
regulate target genes.
