A python package that is a re-implementation of an existing deprecated R Package 

The CoRegNet package aims at inferring a large scale transcription co-regulatory network from transcriptomic data and at integrating external data on gene regulation to infer and analyze transcriptional programs. The particularity of the network inference algorithm proposed in the package is to learn co-regulation network in which gene regulation is modeled by transcription factors acting in a cooperative manner to synergistically regulate target genes.
