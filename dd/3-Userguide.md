# discretizeExpressionData

Converts the user given `numerical_expression` to a discretized data set

$$
\text{n} > \mu - \sigma \times \text{threshold}
$$

\text{n} < \mu + \sigma \times \text{threshold} 
$$ 

Where:
    -1 indicates under-expression,
    0 indicates no change, and 
    1 indicates over-expression.
